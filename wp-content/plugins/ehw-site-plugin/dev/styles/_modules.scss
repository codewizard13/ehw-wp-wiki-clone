/*
MODULE STYLES
- Description: Modules or components are made of multiple elements and can
  have quite complex styles. Tables are complex enough that they can also be
  considered a module. Not every HTML with multiple parts are in the MODULE
  section (e.g., <figure> goes in pix.css). Modules aren't specific to
  any page, but are somewhat universal.
